## Introduction

This is School 42 graphics project about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z).

## Rendering

Your program has to represent the model in isometric projection.

The coordinates of the landscape are stored in a .fdf file passed as a parameter to your program. Here is an example:

<img width="396" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-13 at 22 35 28" src="https://github.com/nikkxll/fdf/assets/125829393/1ff00ef1-a5ec-4ff5-b2d3-a4659b235e68">

Each number represents a point in space:

• The horizontal position corresponds to its axis.

• The vertical position corresponds to its ordinate.

• The value corresponds to its altitude.

Should render a landscape similar to:

## Graphic management

• Your program has to display the image in a window.

• The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).

• Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.

• Clicking on the cross on the window’s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.

• The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.

## Bonus

For the bonus part you would be encouraged to develop your own original extra features. You will get some extra points if you can:

• Include one extra projection (such as parallel or conic)!

• Zoom in and out.

• Translate your model.

• Rotate your model.

• Add one more bonus of your choice.
